                                UX Design refers to the term User Experience Design, while UI Design stands for User
                                Interface Design. Both elements are crucial to a product and work closely together. But
                                despite their professional relationship, the roles themselves are quite different,
                                referring to very different parts of the process and the design discipline. Where UX
                                Design is a more analytical and technical field, UI Design is closer to what we refer to
                                as graphic design, though the responsibilities are somewhat more complex.<br><br>

                                    Web development is the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet or an
                                    intranet. Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain
                                    text to complex web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, and social
                                    network services.
