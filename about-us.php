                            <strong>E-marketing</strong> is the process of marketing a product or service using the Internet. E-marketing not only includes marketing on the Internet, but also includes marketing done via email and wireless media. It uses a range of technologies to help connect businesses to their customers.
                            <br/><br/>
                            As <strong>Yes Soft</strong> has an online-working team, it has many things in common with all electronic activities such as Ecommerce we talked about before. <strong>E-marketing</strong> lays in the same perspective for us. It’s an active discipline in today’s world. And it completes our working strategy, marketing projects we developed.
                            <br/>
                            To reach this point, we deploy several aspects by our high-professional team. For example, we organize social-media and email promotional campaigns as well as content marketing. We make Flyer design which is the first impression a potential client may take. We design business cards, too.
                            You may ask yourself, Does these activities have potential?
                            Of course they have. Do you know that E-marketing reduces marketing campaign cost as the marketing is done through the internet. And it facilitates monitoring through the web tracking capabilities. Finally, do you realize before how many hours do you spend online daily? Answer this question and you’ll get the point yourself.
